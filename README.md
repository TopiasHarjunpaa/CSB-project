FLAW 1 - Injection:
safebanking/views.py
depositView method starting from the line xxx:
Raw sql query has been used in a incorrect way. This allows users to write sql queries to the amount input field. For example user can write "1000--" which removes the WHERE clause and adds 1000 to everyones balance instead of just user.
This can be fixed by replacing the line with cursor.execute("UPDATE safebanking_user_account SET balance = balance + %s WHERE id = %s", [amount, User_account_id]) which prevents possibility for sql instead. Even better way would be using the Django ORM tools and find user with user = User_account.objects.get(id = User_account_id) and then change the balance with user.balance += amount and finally save with user.save(). You can prevent any missuses by using simply if amount >= 0 etc... and handle the incorrect inputs with else: redirect... (in a similar way than it is handled at the transferView method above)
